A simple, clean, and responsive [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme for academics.
If you like the theme, star the [original repo](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio)! If you'd like to make a similar site for yourself, feel free to fork this repo or the original. I provide some links [below](#below) that helped me tweak some technical things in my branch.


## Getting started

For more about how to use Jekyll, check out [this tutorial](https://www.taniarascia.com/make-a-static-website-with-jekyll/).
Why Jekyll? Read this [blog post](https://karpathy.github.io/2014/07/01/switching-to-jekyll/)!


### Installation

Assuming you have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) and [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) installed on your system (*hint: for ease of managing ruby gems, consider using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv)*), first [fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) the theme from `github.com:alshedivat/al-folio` to `github.com:<your-username>/<your-repo-name>` and do the following:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
$ cd <your-repo-name>
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Now, feel free to customize the theme however you like (don't forget to change the name!).
After you are done, **commit** your final changes.
Now, you can deploy your website to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) by running the deploy script. I like to navigate to my local repo and run:

```bash
$ bin/deploy --user
```
By default, the script uses the `master` branch for the source code and deploys the webpage to `gh-pages`.
The optional flag `--user` tells it to deploy to `master` and use `source` for the source code instead.
Using `master` for deployment is a convention for [user and organization pages](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/).

**Note:** when deploying your user or organization page, make sure the `_config.yml` has `url` and `baseurl` fields as follows.

```
url:  # should be empty
baseurl:  # should be empty
```

### Upgrading from a previous version

If you installed **al-folio** as described above, you can upgrade to the latest version as follows:

```bash
# Assuming the current directory is <your-repo-name>
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio.git
$ git fetch upstream
$ git rebase upstream/v0.3.1
```

If you have extensively customized a previous version, it might be trickier to upgrade.
You can still follow the steps above, but `git rebase` may result in merge conflicts that must be resolved.
See [git rebase manual](https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/about-git-rebase) and how to [resolve conflicts](https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/resolving-merge-conflicts-after-a-git-rebase) for more information.
If rebasing is too complicated, we recommend to re-install the new version of the theme from scratch and port over your content and changes from the previous version manually.

## Things tweaked on mariakhoudary.com

1. I spent a ton of time troubleshooting how to host my default mode archive (did you know soundcloud limits your uploads to 3 hours on the free version?? I didn't!). [This post](https://portalzine.de/dev/html5/hosting-mp3-files-on-google-drive-html5-audio-player/) sealed the deal.
2. I followed [this advice](https://gitter.im/alshedivat/al-folio?at=5f5a8890b190f2328e656862) for getting my CV to be a link on the header and not its own page.
3. I hard-coded the order of my sites by creating a variable in the YAML header called `order`. Then in `_includes/header.html`, I went to the section `Other pages` and changed the first line after that comment to `{% assign sorted_pages = site.pages | sort: "order" %}`.
4. Something I'm still trying to figure out how to do: insert a hyperlink under my photo on the `about` page. --> figured it out! you need to use html formatting because it's a variable. template in case, like me, you're learning html as you build your site: `Wondering how to <a href="https://namedrop.io/mariakhoudary" target="_blank">pronounce my name</a>?`
5. **BIG TIP**: you need to be committing all your changes to the `source` branch, not `master`! I've been using Atom to build my site, and thought the Git plugin was pretty neat. I then realized it became my mortal nemesis as I fell deep into the rabbithole of Google & Stackoverflow, trying to figure out why I couldn't deploy the new changes on my site. Turns out, the GUI had been committing to the `master` branch the whole time. I hope this information saves you as much time as I wasted getting to the bottom of it. Just use the goddam terminal.


## FAQ

Here are some frequently asked questions.
If you have a different question, please ask on [gitter](https://gitter.im/alshedivat/al-folio).

1. **Q:** When I preview my website locally everything looks great, but when I deploy it on GitHub bibliography Liquid tags are not recognized.
   How do I fix this? <br>
   **A:** GitHub Pages rendering does not support certain Jekyll plugins, and `jekyll-scholar` that we use to render bibliography is one of them. Please make sure you deploy your website to GitHub using `bin/deploy` script that circumvents the issue.

2. **Q:** When I deploy my fork of al-folio, it says `Deployed successfully!`
   But when I open `<my-github-username>.github.io`, I get `Page not found (404)` error.
   How do I fix this? <br>
   **A:** For personal webpages, please run `bin/deploy --user`.

## License

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

Originally, **al-folio** was based on the [\*folio theme](https://github.com/bogoli/-folio) (published by [Lia Bogoev](http://liabogoev.com) and under the MIT license).
Since then, it got a full re-write of the styles and many additional cool features.
