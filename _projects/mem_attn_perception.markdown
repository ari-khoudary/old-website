In addition to being a proponent of interdisciplinary studies, I also believe that studying how different cognitive systems interact gives us a richer insight both into the function of the individual systems and of the mind more broadly. So far, I've worked on interactions between memory & attention and attention & perception, and I'm excited to further explore these and other interactions as a graduate student.

## Effects of divided attention on recognition and source memory
As a senior, I designed an experiment investigating how divided attention during encoding modulates source and recognition accuracy, confidence, and metacognition. I presented the results at the Boston College Psychology Undergraduate Research Conference (see below) and have submitted a manuscript to [*Mental Note*](https://sites.rutgers.edu/mental-note/). These results are part of a bigger project, my double-credit, interdisciplinary thesis on the psychology and epistemology of episodic memory, which you can check out [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/projects/mem_attn_perception/khoudary_thesis.pdf).

## Exogenous attentional modulation of contrast sensitivity across the visual field
This is a project I worked on with [Michael Jigo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-jigo-0186431b1) during my NSF-REU fellowship in [Marisa Carrasco's lab](https://sites.google.com/site/carrascolabnyu/) at NYU. The experiment (and thus results) changed a lot after the program ended, but here's a snapshot of where we were at when I presented this poster the Summer Student Diversity Conference in 2018.
