Hello! Thanks for stopping by.

My name is Ari Khoudary (they/them/هي), and I'm a PhD student in the [Department of Cognitive Sciences](https://www.cogsci.uci.edu/index.php){:target="_blank"} at the [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu/){:target="_blank"}. I am co-advised by [Aaron Bornstein](https://aaron.bornstein.org){:target="_blank"} and [Megan Peters](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/cnclab/){:target="_blank"}. My research aims to characterize the effects of long-term memory on perceptual decisions, with a focus on how subjective confidence in each evidence source modulates their integration. We use computational modeling of human behavior to answer this question, with plans to include neuroimaging in the near future.

I obtained a B.S. in Psychology (honors) with a second major in Philosophy from [Boston College](https://www.bc.edu){:target="_blank"} in 2019. I wrote a double-credit senior thesis (advised in Psychology by [Maureen Ritchey](http://thememolab.org){:target="_blank"} and in Philosophy by [Richard Atkins](http://rkatkins.com/){:target="_blank"}) on the epistemic reliability of episodic memory, using an original experiment on source monitoring as a case study. Then, I worked as a lab manager and research assistant in [Felipe De Brigard's](https://psychandneuro.duke.edu/people/felipe-de-brigard){:target="_blank"} [Imagination and Modal Cognition Lab](https://imclab.org){:target="_blank"} at [Duke University](https://www.duke.edu){:target="_blank"}, where I did some neuroimaging and experimental philosophy research in addition to helping Felipe and [Walter Sinnott-Armstrong](https://psychandneuro.duke.edu/people/walter-sinnott-armstrong){:target="_blank"} coordinate the [Summer Seminars in Neuroscience and Philosophy (SSNAP)](https://ssnap.net){:target="_blank"}.

On a personal note, I am a queer, non-binary, Syrian-American who cares deeply about the emotional and interpersonal dimensions of scientific research. I have long-standing interests in music, philosophy, food, and interdisciplinary endeavors, as well as a [cat](assets/img/stinky.jpg){:target="_blank"} who I love very much. In my free time, I enjoy hanging out with friends, appreciating nature, and daydreaming about (nearby) possible worlds.
