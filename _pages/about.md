Hello! Thanks for stopping by.

My name is [Maria Khoudary](https://namedrop.io/mariakhoudary){:target="_blank"} (they/them/هي), and I'm a lab manager and research assistant in Felipe De Brigard's [Imagination and Modal Cognition Lab](https://imclab.org){:target="_blank"} at Duke University. I also help [Felipe](https://psychandneuro.duke.edu/people/felipe-de-brigard){:target="_blank"} and [Walter Sinnott-Armstrong](https://psychandneuro.duke.edu/people/walter-sinnott-armstrong){:target="_blank"} coordinate the [Summer Seminars in Neuroscience and Philosophy (SSNAP)](https://ssnap.net){:target="_blank"}, a program that is just as awesome as it sounds.

I graduated *magna cum laude* from Boston College in 2019 with a B.S. in Psychology (honors) and a second major in Philosophy. I wrote my senior thesis on the epistemic reliability of episodic memory, using an original experiment on source monitoring as a case study. I was co-advised by [Maureen Ritchey](https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/mcas/departments/psychology/people/faculty-directory/maureen-ritchey.html){:target="_blank"} and [Richard Atkins](https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/mcas/departments/philosophy/people/faculty-directory/richard-kenneth-atkins.html){:target="_blank"}, with lots of help from members of Maureen's [Memory Modulation Lab](http://thememolab.org){:target="_blank"}.

Beginning in the fall of 2021, I'll be joining [Megan Peters](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/cnclab/){:target="_blank"} at the [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu/){:target="_blank"} to get my PhD in [Cognitive Science](https://www.cogsci.uci.edu/index.php){:target="_blank"} with a concentration in Cognitive Neuroscience. With co-supervision by [Aaron Bornstein](http://aaron.bornstein.org/){:target="_blank"}, I'll be doing a deep dive on metacognition, memory, and computational modeling, and thinking about what that has to do with consciousness. I'm so excited to get started!
