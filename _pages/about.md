Hello! Thanks for stopping by.

My name is Ari Khoudary (they/them/هي), and I'm a PhD student in the [Department of Cognitive Sciences](https://www.cogsci.uci.edu/index.php){:target="_blank"} at the [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu/){:target="_blank"}. I am co-advised by [Aaron Bornstein](https://aaron.bornstein.org){:target="_blank"} and work [Megan Peters](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/cnclab/){:target="_blank"}. My research aims to characterize the effects of long-term memory on perceptual decisions, with a focus on how subjective confidence in each evidence source modulates their integration. We use computational modeling of human behavior to answer this question, with plans to include neuroimaging in the near future.

I obtained a a B.S. in Psychology (honors) and a second major in Philosophy from [Boston College](https://www.bc.edu){:target="_blank"} in 2019. I wrote a double-credit senior thesis (advised in Psychology by [Maureen Ritchey](http://thememolab.org){:target="_blank"} and in Philosophy by [Richard Atkins](http://rkatkins.com/){:target="_blank"}) on the epistemic reliability of episodic memory, using an original experiment on source monitoring as a case study. Then, I then worked as a lab manager and research assistant in Felipe De Brigard's [Imagination and Modal Cognition Lab](https://imclab.org){:target="_blank"} at [Duke University](https://www.duke.edu){:target="_blank"}, where I did some neuroimaging and experimental philosophy research in addition to helping [Felipe](https://psychandneuro.duke.edu/people/felipe-de-brigard){:target="_blank"} and [Walter Sinnott-Armstrong](https://psychandneuro.duke.edu/people/walter-sinnott-armstrong){:target="_blank"} coordinate the [Summer Seminars in Neuroscience and Philosophy (SSNAP)](https://ssnap.net){:target="_blank"}.
