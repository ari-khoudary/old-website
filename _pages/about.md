Hello! Thanks for stopping by.

My name is [Maria Khoudary](https://namedrop.io/mariakhoudary){:target="_blank"} (they/she), and I'm a lab manager and research assistant in Felipe De Brigard's [Imagination and Modal Cognition Lab](https://imclab.org){:target="_blank"} at Duke University. I also help Felipe and Walter Sinnott-Armstrong coordinate the [Summer Seminars in Neuroscience and Philosophy (SSNAP)](https://ssnap.net){:target="_blank"}, a program that is just as awesome as it sounds.

I graduated *magna cum laude* from Boston College in 2019 with a B.S. in Psychology (honors) and a second major in Philosophy. I wrote my senior thesis on the epistemic reliability of episodic memory, using an original experiment on source monitoring as a case study. I was co-advised by Maureen Ritchey and Richard Atkins, with lots of help from members of Maureen's [Memory Modulation Lab](http://thememolab.org){:target="_blank"}.

I'm applying to Ph.D. programs in cognitive neuroscience to pursue my dream of making a career out of studying how the brain creates the mind. I want to use my graduate studies to start integrating memory into  consciousness science, a project that will look different depending on who I end up working with. Some possible topics include: mechanisms of mnemonic metacognition, contributions of episodic memory to perceptual decision-making, delineating first- and second-order properties of memory representations, and internal attentional modulation of recollective processes and phenomenology.
