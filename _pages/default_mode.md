*small note: the descriptions of these episodes is obviously an oversimplification. because the structure is more conversational than a rigid interview, any given episode will cover multiple topics. but something constant throughout all episodes is a commitment to explaining the logic & limits of cognitive neuroscience methods, something I think is deeply important for a public-facing scientific conversation*
